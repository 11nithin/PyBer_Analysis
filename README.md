# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

To create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

To perform the analysis the two data provides are merged and following is created.
- Urban cities has 13 times more riders than rural cities
- Average fare per ride for urban is 1.4 times less than the rural cities and for suburban it is 1.12 times less than rural cities
- Average fare per driver for rural is 3.4 times higher than urban and 1.4 times higher than suburban
- When number of riders and total drivers are less, average fare per ride and average fare per drivers is higher.

#### Total fare by city 

From the graph its clear that the ride sharing companies makes more profit in urban cities than suburban and rural cities

## Summary

Total number of driver in a city have great impact on the Total fare. When number of drivers increase total fare is also increased, eventhough driver makes less money per ride.

I would recommend the company should bring a program to attract more drivers in rural cities and suburban cities. Also when number of drivers average fare per driver decreases, there is chance to loos the drivers/new drivers wont get attracted. To keep the current drivers and attract more drivers, there has to be a new program. Few examples like drivers should have an option to make more money during busy hours. 

It would be also good to do additional anlysis on this like the kilometer driven in each ride, time to complete a ride etc. before any new programs are created.
